            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.<br>
             It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at<br> 
             twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and<br>
             composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when<br>
             hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.
